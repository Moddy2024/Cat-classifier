# Cat-detector
I learned this while I was doing the Deep Learning Course from deeplearning.ai. This is a code for beginners of deep learning.

It's an Deep Neural Network algorithm written in Python which has been trained to differentiate between a picture and tell if it's a picture of a cat or not.
